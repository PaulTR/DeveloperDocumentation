# How to Update Sphero Docs

## Main Layouts

There are two main layouts that can be updated in the docs, `src/layouts/docs.hbs` and `src/layouts/static.hbs`.
The first one you see with the Sphero and Ollie pictures is `static.hbs`, this is the landing page with the options
to select which platform docs you want to visit, it looks like this:

![Static Layout](src/assets/images/static.hbs.png?raw=true "Static Layout")
