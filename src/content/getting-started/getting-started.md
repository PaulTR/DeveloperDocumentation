# Overview

This guide walks you through the basics of creating mobile apps that leverage the Sphero Ollie SDK.
We strive to support **ALL** the various devices available, but there are a few that are known to cause problems.
Visit our [developer forum](http://developer.gosphero.com) or our [StackOverflow tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sphero-api) for more information.
The goal of this developer guide along with sample code is to give the developer a taste of the wide variety of things Ollie can do.
