## Installing an IDE and the Android SDK

Before you begin to develop applications that interface with Sphero Products on Android, you will need to install the Android developer tools and an IDE. In this guide we will use Android Studio since Eclipse is no longer supported for Android development. There are many other well written Android IDEs out there and these configuration steps are most often still applicable.

 - Install [JDK 1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)
 - Install [Android Studio and Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
