# IDE Setup

## Android

*Note: The Sphero Android SDK works with Android 3.1+ and Java Compiler Level 6.0(1.6)+*

### Installing an IDE and the Android SDK

Before you begin to develop applications that interface with robots on Android, you will need to install the Android developer tools and an IDE. In this guide we will use Android Studio since Eclipse is no longer supported for Android development. There are many other well written Android IDEs out there and these configuration steps are most often still applicable.

*Note: You must have JDK 1.7 for Android Studio to work, even though the Robot SDK supports down to 1.6*

 - Install [JDK 1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)
 - Install [Android Studio and Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
