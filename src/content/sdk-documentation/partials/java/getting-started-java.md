	*Android Studio requires JDK 1.7 even though the Robot SDK supports down to 1.6
	*The Sphero Android SDK works with Android 3.1+ and Java Compiler Level 6.0(1.6)+
	*The Ollie Android SDK works with Android 4.3+ and Java Compiler Level 6.0(1.6)+

### 1. Install Android Studio
Before you begin to develop applications that interface with robots on Android, you will need to install the Android developer tools and an IDE. In this guide we will use Android Studio since Eclipse is no longer supported for Android development. There are many other well written Android IDEs out there and these configuration steps are most often still applicable.
