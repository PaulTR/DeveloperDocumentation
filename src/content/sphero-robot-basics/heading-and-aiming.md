## Heading and Aiming

One of the things that makes Sphero so unique is that its heading is relative to the user, not relative to the ball.
This makes it much easier to get Sphero rolling in the direction you want.

The diagram shows how the heading works.

Note that only 90 degree increments are shown in the diagram, but you can specify the heading down to 1 degree.

Each time Sphero is turned on, it needs to be "aimed".
This means setting the direction that Sphero will treat as a heading of 0 degrees.

This is accomplished via Sphero's "tail light".

The tail light is a small blue light inside the Sphero.

Each Sphero app has a button that lets you set the tail light, which looks like this:

To use this button, tap and hold on it, and then slowly move your finger around the circle.
You will see the blue tail light rotate.

When it's pointing directly at you, remove your finger.

Now, if you tell the Sphero to move at a heading of 0 degrees, it will move directly away from you.

The student guides for all of the MacroLab lessons lead you through how to do this.

For an interactive introduction on how to aiming, use the [Sphero app](https://itunes.apple.com/mx/app/sphero/id468699619).

## Aim Your Sphero

To aim your Sphero, first go to your device's home screen and open the MacroLab
or OrbBasic app.

You'll see a circle with two arrows at the bottom of the screen:

Tap on this icon and hold it.

A white circle will appear, move your finger slightly to rotate the internals of the Sphero.

You'll see a blue light inside the ball - this is the tail light.

Continue rotating the Sphero' insides until the tail light is facing you directly.
The Sphero's "back" is now to you.
