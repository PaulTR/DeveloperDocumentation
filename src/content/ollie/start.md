# Intro to Ollie

Meet Ollie – the app-controlled robot driven by adrenaline. Launch over the competition at floor-warping speeds. Spin, drift, and flip with app-powered tricks. Then switch up your ride with custom tires and hubcaps. Ollie is engineered for speed, programmed for tricks, and customized by you.

Ollie pairs instantly to your smart device via Bluetooth LE and is powered by USB charging. Protected by a durable polycarbonate shell and outfitted with glowing LED’s, Ollie is ready to take on any terrain day or night.

## What is Ollie?

Ollie rolls at speeds of up to 14 mph and connects instantly to your device via Bluetooth LE with a range of up to 100 feet. Turn on a dime with the included Nubby Tires or take them off to drift like a street racer. Powered by USB charging, Ollie glows in millions of colors and is ready to roll out.
